#Program 2 – Erehwon Mobile Data Plans
#Erewhon Mobile charges cellular customers a rate based on the total amount of data used by a customer 
# in the billing period. For simplicity, customers are charge based on which range their total data usage 
# falls within.
# Note, it is not a cumulative charge; your program will figure out which single range the usage falls into, 
# then calculate the cost based on that range’s cost.
